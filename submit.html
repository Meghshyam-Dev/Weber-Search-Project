      <h3>What kind of pages get indexed?</h3>
      <p>
        Pages must be simple in design. Simple HTML, <b>non-commerical</b> sites are preferred.<br> 
        <b>Pages should not use much scripts/css for cosmetic effect.</b> Some might squeak through.<br>
	    Don't use ads that are intrusive (such as ads that appear overtop of content).<br>
	    Don't submit a page which serves primarily as a portal to other bloated websites.<br>
	    Avoid submitting multiple tens of pages from one person's website.<br>
	    If your page does not contain any text or uses frames, ensure a meta description tag is added.<br>
	    In most cases, only the page you submit will be crawled.<br>
      </p>
      <p class="pin">
        <br><br>Note:<br>
	<br>The WeberBot (172.93.49.252) is occasionally rejected by some web servers. 
	<br>Barring technical issues, if you are puzzled why a site wasn't indexed, reread the above guide.
	<br>Angelfire and Tripod pages are no longer grandfathered (ads are too intrusive).
